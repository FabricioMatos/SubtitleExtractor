the resources to...

183
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,133
I still pay my taxes.

184

Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

185
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,839
Well, it doesn't go
to the university.

186
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,708
Look, Coop,
you have to be realistic.

187
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,943
You're ruling my son out
for college now?

188
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,078
The kid's 15.

189
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,980
Tom's score simply
isn't high enough.

190
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,117
What's your waistline?
About 32?

191
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,853
About a 33 inseam?

192
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,855
I'm not sure I see
what you're getting at.

193
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,823
You're telling me
it takes two numbers

194
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,157
to measure your own ass

195
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,826
but only one to measure
my son's future?

You're a well-educated man,
Coop.

198
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,933
And a trained pilot.
And an engineer.

199
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:11,038
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

200
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,707
We didn't run out of
television screens and planes.

201
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,843
We ran out of food.

202
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,746
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

203
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,080
And Tom.

204
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,048
Uneducated farmers.

205
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,417
We're a caretaker generation,
Coop.

206
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,453
And things are getting better.

207
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,088
Maybe your grandkids
will get to be engineers...

208
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,156
Are we done here, sir?

209
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:31,458
No.

210
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,829
Ms. Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

211
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,365
MS. HANLEY: Murph is a great
kid. She's really bright.

212
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,834
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

213
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,335
She brought this in
to show the other students.

214
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,171
The section
on the lunar landings.

215
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,206
Yeah,
it's one of my old textbooks.

216
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,209
She always loved the pictures.

217
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,844
It's an old federal textbook.

218
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,880
We've replaced them
with the corrected versions.

219
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,481
Corrected?

220
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,416
Explaining how
the Apollo missions were faked

221
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,051
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

222
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,794
You don't believe
we went to the moon?

223
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,864
I believe it was a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

224
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,266
That the Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources

225
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,769
into rockets
and other useless machines.

226
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,170
"Useless machines."

227
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,006
And if we don't want
a repeat of the excess

228
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,474
and wastefulness
of the 20th century, then

229
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,310
we need to teach our kids
about this planet,

230
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,812
not tales of leaving it.

231
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,447
You know, one of those
useless machines

232
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,350
they used to make
was called an MRI.

233
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,285
And if we had
any of those left,

234
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,821
the doctors would've
been able to find

235
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,455
the cyst in my wife's brain

236
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,958
before she died
instead of afterwards.

237
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,192
And then she'd have been
the one sitting here,

238
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,028
listening to this
instead of me,

239
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,162
which would have
been a good thing,

240
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,763
'cause she was always

241
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,866
the calmer one.

242
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,435
I'm sorry about your wife,
Mr. Cooper.

243
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,405
But Murph got into a fistfight

244
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,941
with several of her classmates
over this

245
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,876
 Apollo nonsense.

246
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,044
So we thought it would be best

247
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,378
to bring you in
and see what ideas

248
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,880
you might have for dealing
with her behavior

249
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:00,914
on the homefront.

250
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,515
All right. (INHALES)

Yeah, you know what? Um...
There's a game tomorrow night.

252
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,121
She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

253
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,990
Her favorite team is playing,
and there's gonna be candy

254
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,524
and soda...

255
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,496
I think I'll take her to that.

00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,840
I got you suspended.

00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:27,574

260
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,344
This is Cooper, go.

261
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,147
 Coop, those combines 
 you rebuilt went haywire. 

262
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,950
Uh, just reset
the controllers.

263
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,952
 I did that. 
 You should come take a look.

peeling off the fields

Something's interfering
with the compass.

267

Magnetism or some such.

about which book.

269
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,228
I've been working on it,
like you said.

270
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,397

is trying to communicate.

00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,009
Yeah.

what Morse code is, Murph.

compass clock and GPS

281
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,730
to offset for the anomaly.

in the sky and wonder

at our place in the stars.

00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,510

you were good at something

to do anything with it.

that was giving you this food

00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,384
Thirty-three.

359
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,388
That's it.

360
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,891
I can't miss this!
(SIGHS)

361
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,560
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

362
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,930
But you don't know
what you're gonna find.

363
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,400
And that

364
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,536
is why I can't take you.

365
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:23,710
Murph?

366
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,647
Grandpa will be home
in a while.

367
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,416
Tell him I'll call him
on the radio.

368
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,489
(YELPS)
COOPER: Jeez!

369
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:38,925
What are you doing?

370
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,427
(LAUGHING)

371
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,762
Oh, you think this is funny?
Huh?

372
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,631
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

373
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,767
Make yourself useful.

374
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,568
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

375
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,099
(SOFTLY) Hey, Murph?

376
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:55,835
Murph!

377
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,708
I think this is
the end of the road.

378
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,779
Didn't you bring
the bolt cutters?

379
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,048
That's my girl.

380
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:37,677
MALE GUARD: Step away
from the fence!

381
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,011
No, no, no.

382
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,613
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed.

383
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,014
My daughter's in the car.

find this place?

388
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,839
Where's my daughter?

389
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,007
TARS: You had the
coordinates for this facility

390
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,542
marked on your map.

391
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,877
Where did you get
those coordinates?

392
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,244
COOPER: (SHOUTING)
Where's my daughter?

393
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,279
TARS: Don't make me
take you down again.

394
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,748
Sit down!

395
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,884
COOPER: Oh, you still think
you're a Marine, pal?

396
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,887
Marines don't exist anymore.

397
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,123
And I got grunts like you
mowing my grass.

398
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,058
TARS: Where did you find
those coordinates?

399
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:28,961
But you don't look much like
a lawnmower.

400
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,631
Think I'll turn you into an
overqualified vacuum cleaner.

WOMAN: No, you won't.

402
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,002
TARS, back down, please.

403
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,808
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military as security.

404
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:45,645
They're old, and their control
units are unpredictable.

405
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,079
It's what the government
could spare.

407
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:49,982
Who are you?

408
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,652
Dr. Brand.

409
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,021
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

410
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,123
What makes you think I'm not?

411
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,991
Oh, wasn't near
as cute, either.

412
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:00,893
Please, Dr. Brand.

413
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:01,861
I don't have
any idea what this is.

414
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,665
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and I want her by my side.

415
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:06,966
You give me that,

416
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:07,767
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

417
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,805
Get the principals

418
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,106
and the girl in
the conference room, please.

419
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:16,909
Your daughter is fine.

420
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,277
Bright kid.

421
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,380
Must have a very smart mother.

422
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,150
It's pretty clear
you don't want any visitors.

423
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:25,818
So why don't you just
let us back up from your fence

424
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,020
and we'll be on our way? Huh?

425
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,288
It's not that simple.

426
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,023
Well, sure, it is.

427
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,692
I don't know
anything about you.

428
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,260
I don't know
anything about this place.

429
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,328
Yes, you do.

430
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,135
Dad!

431
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:46,906
Hello, Cooper.

432
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:49,341
Professor Brand.

433
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,146
WILLIAMS: Explain to me
how you found this facility.

434
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,982
Kind of an accident.
We stumbled upon it.

435
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,850
We were on a salvage run...

436
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,653
You're sitting in the
best-kept secret in the world.

437
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:04,290
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

438
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,624
PROFESSOR BRAND:
Cooper... Please.

439
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,127
Cooperate with these people.

440
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,095
Look.

441
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,999
It's kind of hard to explain.

442
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,669
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

443
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,171
What sort of anomaly?

444
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:21,207
I hesitate to
term it supernatural,

445
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,842
(CHUCKLES) but it definitely
wasn't scientific.

446
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,111
You're going to have to be
specific, Mr. Cooper.

447
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,045
Right now.

448
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,413
It was gravity.

449
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,018
DOYLE: Um...

450
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,687
What sort of
gravitational anomaly?

451
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,955
Where was this?
COOPER: Hey.

452
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,423
Now I'm real happy

453
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,792
'cause you're excited
about gravity, bud,

454
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:40,927
but you're not getting
any answers from us

455
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,261
until I get assurances.

456
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:43,796
Assurances?
Yeah.

457
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,833
Like that we're
getting out of here.

458
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,267
And I don't mean
in the trunk of some car.

459
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,836
(ALL LAUGHING)

460
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,105
Don't you know
who we are, Coop?

461
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,907
No, Professor, I don't.

462
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:56,242
BRAND: You know my father,
Professor Brand.

463
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,144
We're NASA.

464
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,380
NASA?

465
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,915
PROFESSOR BRAND: NASA.

466
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,283
The same NASA you flew for.

467
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,797
COOPER: I heard
they shut you down, sir,

468
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,932
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere

469
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:22,034
onto starving people.

470
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:24,470
When they realized that
killing other people was

471
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:27,306
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

472
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,776
In secret.
Why secret?

473
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,277
Because public opinion
wouldn't allow

474
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,946
spending on space exploration.

475
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,748
Not when you're struggling
to put food on the table.

476
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,185
Blight.

477
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,488
Wheat seven years ago.
Okra this year.

478
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,892
Now there's just corn.

479
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,960
And we're growing
more than we ever have.

480
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:50,096
But like the potatoes
in Ireland

481
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,730
and the wheat
in the Dust Bowl,

482
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,801
the corn will die.

483
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:56,468
Soon.

484
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,477
We'll find a way, Professor.
We always have.

485
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:10,249
Driven by the unshakeable
faith the Earth is ours.

486
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,819
Well, not just ours, no.

487
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,854
But it is our home.

488
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:20,026
Earth's atmosphere
is 80% nitrogen.

489
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,994
We don't even
breathe nitrogen.

490
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,196
Blight does.
And as it thrives,

491
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,498
our air gets
less and less oxygen.

492
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,035
The last people to starve

493
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,103
will be the first
to suffocate.

494
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,872
And your daughter's generation

495
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,243
will be the last
to survive on Earth.

496
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,045
BRAND: Murph is feeling
a little tired.

497
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,279
I was wondering if she could
take a nap in my office.

498
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,314
Yeah. Thank you.

499
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,252
Okay.

500
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,021
Now you need to tell me

501
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,891
what your plan is
to save the world.

502
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,993
We're not meant
to save the world.

503
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:54,994
We're meant to leave it.

504
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,534
COOPER: Rangers.

505
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:03,735
PROFESSOR BRAND:
The last components

506
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,506
of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance. 

507
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,008
Our final expedition.

508
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,578
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

509
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,281
The Lazarus missions.

510
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,548
Oh, that sounds cheerful.

511
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,918
Lazarus came back
from the dead.

512
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,252
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

513
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,855
There's not a planet
in our solar system

514
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:24,323
that could sustain life

515
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,093
and the nearest star's
over 1,000 years away.

516
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,161
And that doesn't even
qualify as futile.

517
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,131
Where'd you send 'em?

518
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,566
Cooper,

519
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,236
I can't tell you any more
unless you agree

520
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,505
to pilot this craft.

521
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,107
You're the best pilot
we ever had.

522
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,109
I barely left
the stratosphere.

523
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,877
This team never
left the simulator.

524
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:46,946
We need a pilot,

525
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,348
and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

526
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,482
Without even knowing it?

527
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,253
An hour ago, you didn't even
know I was alive.

528
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,922
You were going anyway.

529
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,357
We had no choice.

530
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,892
But something sent you here.

531
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,593
They chose you.

532
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,594
Who's "they"?

533
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,471
How long would I be gone?

534
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,573
Hard to know.

535
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,208
Years?

536
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,344
I've got kids, Professor.

537
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,047
Get out there and save them.

538
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,518
Who's "they"?

539
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,654
We started detecting
gravitational anomalies

540
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,589
almost 50 years ago.

541
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,558
Mostly small distortions
to our instruments

542
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,426
in the upper atmosphere.

543
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,096
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

544
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:39,631
Yeah, over the Straits.

545
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,301
My crash.

546
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,469
Something tripped
my fly-by-wire.

547
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,204
Exactly.

548
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:51,077
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

549
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,078
Out near Saturn,

550
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,347
a disturbance of spacetime.

551
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,351
Is that a wormhole?

552
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,087
It appeared 48 years ago.

553
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,989
And it leads where?

554
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,124
Another galaxy.

555
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,395
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

556
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,529
Someone placed it there.

557
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,632
"They"?
Mmm-hmm.

558
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,601
And whoever they are,

559
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,504
they appear to be
looking out for us.

560
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,207
That wormhole
lets us travel to other stars.

561
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,275
It came along
right as we needed it.

562
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,643
They've put potentially
habitable worlds

563
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,412
right within our reach.

564
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,580
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

565
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,050
You sent probes into that?
Mmm-hmm.

566
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,519
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

567
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,356
The Lazarus missions.

568
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,991
PROFESSOR BRAND:
Twelve possible worlds,

569
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:40,426
12 Ranger launches
carrying

570
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:44,096
the bravest humans
ever to live,

571
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,999
led by the remarkable
Dr. Mann.

572
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,467
Each person's landing pod

573
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,336
had enough life support
for two years.

574
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,404
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that,

575
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:54,240
making observations
on organics

576
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,042
over a decade or more.

577
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,177
Their mission was
to assess their world,

578
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,112
and if it showed potential,

579
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,613
then they could
send out a signal,

580
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,550
bed down for the long nap,
wait to be rescued.

581
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,285
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

582
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,254
Hence the bravery.

583
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,557
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

584
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,025
No.

585
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,263
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

586
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:19,431
Simple binary pings
on an annual basis

587
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:22,334
give us some clue as to
which worlds have potential.

588
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,570
And one system shows promise.

589
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,638
One. That's a bit of
a long shot, isn't it?

590
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,110
One system
with three potential worlds?

591
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,378
(CHUCKLES) No long shot.

592
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:35,581
Okay.

593
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,650
So if we find a home,

594
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:43,055
then what?

595
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,457
That's the long shot.

596
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:49,328
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

597
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,729
Did you notice
anything strange

598
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:51,663
about the launch chamber?

599
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:07,279
COOPER: This entire facility's
a centrifuge.

600
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,848
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

601
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,118
PROFESSOR BRAND: Both. Plan A.

602
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,420
How do you get it
off the ground?

603
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:18,390
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

604
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:22,794
Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real.

605
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,131
So I started
working on a theory

606
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:27,766
and we started
building this station.

607
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,568
But you haven't solved it yet.

608
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,304
That's why there's Plan B.

609
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,241
The problem is gravity.

610
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,743
How to get a viable amount of
human life off the planet.

611
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,545
This is one way.

612
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,381
Plan B: a population bomb.

613
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,750
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs

614
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,752
weighing in at
just under 900 kilos.

615
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,755
Well, how would you raise 'em?

616
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,224
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

617
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,260
After that, with surrogacy,

618
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,661
the growth
becomes exponential.

619
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,364
Within 30 years,

620
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,399
we could have
a colony of hundreds.

621
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,201
The real difficulty
with colonization

622
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,302
is genetic diversity.

623
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,338
This takes care of that.

624
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:08,140
But what about
the people here? You just...

625
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:09,741
You give up on 'em?

626
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:11,610
My kids?

627
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,514
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

628
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,185
How far have you got?

629
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:19,885
Almost there.

630
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,289
You're asking me
to hang everything

631
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,591
on an almost.

632
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,494
I'm asking you to trust me.

633
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,730
(SIGHS)

634
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,265
Find us a new home.

635
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,935
And by the time you return,

636
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,271
I will have solved the problem
of gravity.

637
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,640
I give you my word.

638
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:55,821
MURPH: Go away!

639
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,297
(SIGHING)

640
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,400
Murph.

641
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,902
Go! If you're leaving,
just go.

642
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,608
DONALD: This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

643
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,478
What, because
heading out there

644
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,280
is what I feel like
I was born to do?

645
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,915
And it excites me?

646
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,586
No, that does not
make it wrong.

647
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,521
DONALD: It might.

648
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,890
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

649
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,527
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

650
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,363
And the foundation's solid.

651
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,302
We farmers,
we sit here every year

652
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,504
when the rains fail
and we say,

653
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:46,938
"Next year."

654
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:49,741
Well, next year
ain't gonna save us,

655
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,410
nor the one after that.

656
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:53,979
This world's
a treasure, Donald,

657
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,382
but it's been telling us
to leave for a while now.

658
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,954
Mankind was born on Earth,

659
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,790
it was never meant
to die here.

660
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:09,661
Tom will be all right,

661
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,229
but you got to
make things right with Murph.

662
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,464
I will.

663
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,535
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

664
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,247
You have to talk to me, Murph.

665
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,553
I need to fix this
before I go.

666
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,788
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

667
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,393
After you kids came along,
your mom,

668
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:43,495
she said something to me
I never quite understood.

669
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,497
She said, "Now,

670
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:51,770
"we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

671
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,478
And I think now I understand
what she meant.

672
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:04,783
Once you're a parent,

673
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,885
you're the ghost
of your children's future.

674
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,722
You said ghosts didn't exist.

675
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:18,697
That's right, Murph.

676
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,335
Murph, look at me.

677
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,774
And I can't be
your ghost right now.

678
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,611
I need to exist.

679
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,047
They chose me.

680
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,817
Murph, they chose me.

681
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,786
You saw. You're the one
who led me to 'em.

682
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,891
That's exactly
why you can't go.

683
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,329
I figured out the message.

684
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,366
One word. Know what it is?

685
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,435
"Stay."

686
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,437
It says, "Stay," Dad.

687
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,405
(WHISPERS) Murph.

688
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,641
You don't believe me.

689
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,611
Look at the books!
Look at this. It says, "Stay."

690
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,714
Why... You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

691
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,382
No, I'm coming back.

692
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:11,817
When?

693
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:16,755
(SNIFFLES)

695
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:28,400
One for you, one for me.

00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:31,637
When I'm up there in
hypersleep, or... (SNIFFLES)

697
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,739
Or traveling
near the speed of light, or

698
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,876
near a black hole,

699
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,813
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

700
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,150
When we get back,

701
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,487
we're gonna compare.

702
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,721
MURPH: Time will
run differently for us?

703
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:50,622
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

704
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,425
By the time I get back,

705
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:56,394
we might even be
the same age, you and me.

706
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,997
"What?" Imagine that!

707
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,471
Aw, Murph...

708
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,573
You have no idea
when you're coming back.

709
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:10,809
No idea at all!

Murphy...
(SOBBING)

711
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,881
Murph, don't make me
leave like this.

712
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,684
Come on, Murph!

Hey...

716
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,730
I love you.

717
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,500
Forever. You hear me?

718
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,035
I love you forever.
And I'm coming back.

719
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,109
I'm coming back.

720
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,962
How'd it go?

721
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:04,763
COOPER: It went fine.

722
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,464
Just fine.

723
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:14,339
I love you, Tom.

724
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,576
Travel safe, yeah?
Yeah.

725
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,044
You look after our place
for me, all right?

726
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,679
All right?
Uh-huh.

727
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:27,719
Hey, can I use your truck
while you're gone?

728
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:29,220
You mean your truck?

729
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,524
I'll make sure
they bring it back.

00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,227
Look after my kids, Donald!

00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,876

Everybody good?

751
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,766
Plenty of slaves
for my robot colony?

752

They gave him a humor setting,

753
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:53,371
so he'd fit in better
with his unit.

754
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,173
He thinks it relaxes us.

755
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,843
A giant sarcastic robot.

756
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,746
What a great idea!

00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:01,847
TARS: I have a cue light
I can use

758
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,181
when I'm joking if you like.

759
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,050
That'd probably help.

760
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,652
Yeah, you can use it to find
your way back into the ship

761
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,986
after I blow you
out the airlock.

762

What's your
humor setting, TARS?

763
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,791

We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

780
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:17,422
We should learn to talk.

781
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:18,790
And when not to.

782
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:23,194
Just being honest.

783
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,897
I don't think
you need to be that honest.

784
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:27,766
Hey, TARS,
what's your honesty parameter?

785
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,300
90%.

786
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,369
90%?

787
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:34,740
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the

788
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,674
safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

789
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,143
Okay.

790
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:41,212
90% it is, Dr. Brand.

791
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,985
We are coming up
on the Endurance. 

792
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,153
Twelve minutes out.

793
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:07,338
Okay. Taking control.

500 meters.

Nice and easy, Doyle.
Nice and easy.

00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,787

798
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:56,754

Okay, helmets on.

802
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:09,968
Good job.

804
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:46,872
Never mind.

805
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:11,262
Cooper,
you should have control.

806
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:12,931

some Dramamine in the hab pod.

I'm just gonna go get that.

 for your trajectory.

find another one like her.

No, it's not like
looking for a new condo.

858
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,186
The human race is going to be

859
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,388
adrift,

desperate for a rock
it can cling to

862
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,594
We need to find that rock.

863
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:06,297
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what

864
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:08,733
might sustain human life.

865
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:11,436
Laura Miller's planet
is first.

00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:12,570

00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:21,112
Tell me about Edmunds.

Oh, uh...
Wolf's a particle physicist.

871
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,487
None of them
had families, huh?

872
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:33,791
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

873
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,693

874
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,728
ever seeing
another human being again.

at least three of them.

00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:44,202
Well, he's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

878
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:46,437
He inspired 11 people
to follow him

in human history.

No. Formidable.
Frightening. But...

887
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,424
No, not evil.

888
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:12,297
Well, is a lion evil because
it rips a gazelle to shreds?

889
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,731
Just what we take
with us, is that it?

890
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,501
Yeah.

891
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:18,369
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

892

00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,772
You know what? We agreed, 90%.

894
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:22,640
There you go.

895
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:24,642
Don't stay up.

896
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,876
I'll be there in a minute.

897
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,812
Just remember, Coop,

898
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,680
you are literally
wasting your breath.

00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,323
COOPER: Hey, TARS?

900
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:40,291
Let's go over that trajectory
one more time.

901
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:42,493

903
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:46,831
Fourteen months to Saturn.
Nothing's changed on that.

904
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,633
Just let me ask you something.

906
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,405

00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:57,742

Dr. Brand and Edmunds.

908
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,344
They close?

909
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:01,212
I wouldn't know.

910
00:53:01,246 --> 00:53:03,981
Is that 90% "wouldn't know"
or 10% "wouldn't know"?

911
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,850
I also have
a discretion setting, Cooper.

912
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:06,917
Oh.

913
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,521
But not a poker face, Slick.

914
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:23,801
Hey, guys.

915
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:28,473
Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

916
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,908
 So I wanted to 
 give you an update. 

917
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,977
 Uh... 

918
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,879
 The Earth looks 
 amazing from here. 

919
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,983

 I really hope 
 you guys are doing great. 

922
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,023
 I know you're gonna 
 get this message. 

923
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,426
 Professor Brand's assured me 
 that he's gonna get it to you. 

924
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:50,895
 Know that I love you. 

925
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:53,964
Is it him?

926
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:54,699
DONALD:
I don't think so, Murph.

927
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,341
You must be Donald.

928
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,644
Hello, Murph.

929
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,447
Why are you in my dad's truck?

930
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,283
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

931
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:15,019
He sent you a message.

932
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,691
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

933
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:22,560
If you record any messages,

934
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,495
I can get them
to transmit it to Cooper.

935
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,333
Murph is a bright spark.

936
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:32,537
Maybe I should fan the flame.

937
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,406
She's already making fools
of her teachers.

938
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,608
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

939
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:40,411
So where are they?

940
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:41,546
Heading for Mars.

941
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,582
The next time
you hear from Cooper,

942
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,351
they'll be coming up
on Saturn.

YOUNG TOM: ...school goes, 

944
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,127
 the administration wants me 
 to repeat plant pathology. 

945
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,095
 Which sucks. 

946
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,698
 But they said I could start

00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:34,932

 a year early. 

948
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:40,671
 All right, I got to go, Dad. 
 Hope you're safe up there.

DONALD: I'm sorry, Coop. 

950
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,946
 I asked Murph to say hi, 

951
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,982
 but she's as stubborn 
 as her old man. 

952
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,551
 I'll try again next time. 

953
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:09,967
COOPER: You all right, Rom?

954
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,572

they're done.

This is from the relay probe?

It was in orbit
around the wormhole.

This is the wormhole,

972
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,568
and every time
we'd come around,

973
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:19,136
we would receive images

00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,779
what we're gonna find
on the other side, huh?

Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

990
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:06,684
It's a sphere.

991
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:09,920
Of course it is. You thought
it would just be a hole?

how it works.

So they say you want to
go from here to there.

999
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,205
So a wormhole
bends space like this,

1000
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,174
so you can take
a shortcut through

1001

1002
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,545
Okay, so,

1003
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:35,980

into two dimensions,

01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:15,025
Well, that's relativity,
folks.

1070
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:19,329
Well, we can't just
drop down there without...

1071
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:21,398
Cooper, we have a mission.

1072
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,599
Yeah, Doyle,
we have a mission,

1073
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,401
and our mission Plan A is

1074
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,236
to find a planet that
can habitate the people

1075
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,872
that are living
on the Earth right now.

1076
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,273
You can't just think
about your family.

1077
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,507
Now, you have to think
bigger than that, all right?

1078
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,142
I am thinking about my family

1079
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:34,144
and millions of
other families, okay?

1080
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,313
Plan A does not work
if the people on Earth

1081
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:37,882
are dead by the time
we pull it off.

1082
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,418
No. It doesn't.

1083
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:42,853
That's why there's a Plan B.

1084
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:46,891
Okay. Cooper's right.

1085
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:48,292
We need to think about time
as a resource,

1086
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:49,860
just like oxygen and food.

1087
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:50,260
Going down there
is gonna cost us.

1088
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,830
All right, look.

1089
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,534
Dr. Mann's data
is promising, right,

1090
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,236
but it's going to take us
months to get there.

1091
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:01,305
And Edmunds',
it's even further.

1092
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,539
Now Miller hasn't said much,

1093
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,008
but what she has said
is very promising.

1094
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,609
It's water, it's organics...

1095
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:06,576
You don't find that every day.

1096
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,278
No, you don't.

1097
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,915
And just think about
the resources, including time,

1098
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:12,616
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

1099
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:15,920
Romilly?
Yeah.

1100
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:18,022
How far off from Miller's
planet do we have to be

1101
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:20,190
to stay out of the time shift?

1102
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:21,458
Just back from the cusp.

1103
01:04:22,126 --> 01:04:23,493
Which is here,

1104
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,129
just outside of
Miller's planet.

1105
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:26,496
ROMILLY: Right.
Okay.

1106
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:31,068
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

1107
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:32,569
Instead of taking
the Endurance 

1108
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,104
into orbit
around Miller's planet,

1109
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:35,472
which would conserve fuel,

1110
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,407
but we would lose
a lot of time,

1111
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:40,210
what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

1112
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:41,545
parallel with Miller's planet,

1113
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:44,114
outside of this time shift,
to here?

1114
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:45,415
Then we take the Ranger down,

1115
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:47,217
we get Miller,
we get her samples.

1116
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:48,585
We come back,
we analyze, we debrief.

1117
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,187
We're in, we're out.

1118
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,422
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a lot of time.

1119
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:54,291
That'll work.
That's good.

1120
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:55,659
There's not gonna be time

1121
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:57,461
for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

1122
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:00,164
So, TARS, you should
definitely stay here.

1123
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,632
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

1124
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,568
If we're talking
about a couple years,

1125
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:06,336
I could use the time
to research gravity.

1126
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,005
Observations from
the wormhole,

1127
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,439
that's gold
to Professor Brand.

1128
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:11,375
TARS, factor an orbit
of Gargantua.

1129
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,610
Conserve fuel,
minimize thrusting,

1130
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,980
but make sure we stay
in range of Miller's planet.

1131

You got it?

1132
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,582

leave you behind,

Yup.

for both of us.

yeah, we'd solve gravity.

get anything from it?

What happened to Miller?

1274
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:05,241
Judging by the wreckage,
she was

1275

broken up by a wave
soon after impact.

1278
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,750
Because of the time slippage.

she just landed hours ago.

1280

Don't shake your head at me.

1297
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:07,170
Time is relative, okay?

1298
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:10,774
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but

1299
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:13,242
it can't run backwards.
It just can't.

1300
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:16,112
The only thing that can move
across dimensions, like time,

1301
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:17,046
is gravity.

1302
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:20,950
Okay.

1303
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:27,323

they communicate

1304
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,726
through gravity, right?
(WHISPERS) Yes.

1305
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:31,094
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

1306
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:33,597
Maybe.

1307
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,230
Okay. If they can...

1308
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:39,803
"They" are beings
of five dimensions.

1309
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:42,606
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

1310
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:44,140
To them,

1311
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:46,743
the past might be a canyon

1312
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:49,679
that they can climb into
and the future,

1313
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:51,948
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

1314
01:15:53,617 --> 01:15:55,551
Look, Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

1315
01:15:57,987 --> 01:15:59,689
But you knew about relativity.

1322
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:17,173
Couldn't you have told her you
were going to save the world?

1323
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:18,875
No.

you want to make sure

1328
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:32,856

But I stopped believing
you were coming back.

1353
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,000
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1354
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:28,471
I learned what I could
from the black hole,

1355

(WHISPERS) Hey, Murph.

1418
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:48,637
 You son of a bitch. 

1419
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:55,611
 I never made one of these 
 when you were still responding 

1420
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,413
 because I was so mad at you 
 for leaving. 

1421
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:02,518
 And then when you went quiet, 

1422
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,156
 it seemed like I should 
 live with that decision. 

1423
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,124
 And I have. 

1424
01:22:12,996 --> 01:22:15,031
 But today's my birthday. 

1425
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:22,071
 And it's a special one, 
 because you told me...

 You once told me that 
 when you came back,

01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,279
 we might be the same age.

1435
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:00,043
It's just that I've never
seen you in here before.

I talk to Amelia all the time.

It helps.

I needed to get out.

they're still out there.

1443

MURPH: I know.

1444
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:20,463
There are so many reasons
their communications

1445
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,530
might not be getting through.

1446
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:23,199
I know, Professor.

1447
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:26,635
I'm not sure
what I'm more afraid of.

1448

Them never coming back,

1449
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,044
or coming back
to find we've failed.

1450
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:36,179
Then let's succeed.

1451
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:38,347

we've tried that
hundreds of times.

1456
01:23:47,256 --> 01:23:50,426
It only has to
work once, Murph.

1457
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:58,334
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1458
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,436
We've done well
for the world here,

1459
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:02,605
whether or not
we crack the equation

1460
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:05,341
before I kick the bucket.

1461

Don't be morbid, Professor.

01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:21,657
MURPH: Time.

1466
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:25,328
You're afraid of time.

1467
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:30,466
For years, we've been
trying to solve the equation

1468
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:31,500
without changing
the underlying assumption

1469
01:24:31,534 --> 01:24:33,236
about time.

1470
01:24:33,269 --> 01:24:35,238
And?
And that means

1471
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:39,742
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1472
01:24:39,775 --> 01:24:41,877
It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.

No, I'm saying
you've been trying to

1476

finish it with one arm...

1477

No, with both arms
tied behind your back.

Can we take this point up
at another time?

I want to talk to my daughter.

1482
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:09,805
 PROFESSOR BRAND: Stepping out 
 into the universe, 

1483
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:12,841
 we must confront the reality 
 of interstellar travel. 

1484
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:19,348
 We must reach far beyond 
 our own lifespans. 

1485
01:25:19,382 --> 01:25:23,652
 We must think not as 
 individuals but as a species.

kept the Endurance 

1488
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:34,730
right where we needed her.

1489
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:37,800
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1490
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:41,337
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1491
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,538
We have to choose.

1494
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,347
Edmunds' data is better,

1495
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:54,283
but Dr. Mann is the one
still transmitting.

1496
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:55,418
We've no reason to suspect

1497
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:56,685
Edmunds' data
would have soured.

1498
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:00,623
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1499
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,258
As does Dr. Mann's.

1501

And...

1502
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:08,697
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1503
01:26:08,931 --> 01:26:10,833
Why?

1504
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:12,301

But no life. Sterile.

1507
01:26:21,244 --> 01:26:21,877
We'll find the same thing
on Mann's.

1508
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:24,647

Whatever can happen
will happen.

building block of evolution.

a black hole,

1513
01:26:31,787 --> 01:26:33,556

and comets,

otherwise reach you.

1518
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,401
was the best of us.

1519
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:47,670
He's remarkable.

1520
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,771
We're only here
because of him.

1521
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:51,607
And yet here he is.

1522
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,442
He's on the ground,

1523
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:55,878
and he's sending a very
unambiguous message,

1524
01:26:55,911 --> 01:26:58,847
telling us to
come to his planet.

1525
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:02,885
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1526
01:27:03,686 --> 01:27:04,787

He has a right to know.

1531

That has nothing
to do with it.

with Wolf Edmunds.

yet understand.

Lois, I have a friend who

1591
01:30:20,783 --> 01:30:22,117
(COOP COUGHING)

1592
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,686
could look at his lungs.

1593
01:30:42,204 --> 01:30:43,639
COOPER: Amelia, I'm sorry.

1594
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:44,940
You were just
being objective.

1595
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:46,875
Unless you're punishing me

1596
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:48,811
for screwing up
on Miller's planet.

1597
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:50,646
No, this wasn't
a personal decision.

1598
01:30:51,747 --> 01:30:53,048
If you're wrong,

1599
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:56,084
you will have a very personal
decision to make.

1600
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:59,187
Your fuel calculations are
based on a return journey.

1601
01:30:59,221 --> 01:31:01,557
Strike out on Mann's planet,

1602
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,592
and we'll have to decide
whether to return home

1603
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:06,128
or push on to Edmunds'
with Plan B.

1604
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:09,932
Starting a colony
could save us from extinction.

1605
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,567
You might have to
decide between

1606
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,201
seeing your children again

1607
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:14,737
and the future
of the human race.

1608
01:31:16,672 --> 01:31:17,806
I trust you'll be
as objective then.

1609
01:31:25,113 --> 01:31:27,182
He's been asking for you
since he came to.

1610
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:28,483
We were trying to reach you.

1611
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:35,490
Murph.

1612
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:37,893
Hi. I'm here, Professor.

1613
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,764
(WEAKLY) I let them all down.

1614
01:31:41,797 --> 01:31:44,700
No, you got us so far!
Real close.

1615
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:48,771
I'll finish what you started.

1616
01:31:48,804 --> 01:31:50,706
Good, good, Murph.

1617
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:55,143
You had faith

1618
01:31:56,779 --> 01:31:57,746

1619
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,583

I...

1621
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:06,021
I asked you to have faith.

1622
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:10,659
I wanted you to believe

1623
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,996
that your father

1624
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:19,134
would come back.

1625
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:20,202
I do, Professor.

1626
01:32:22,104 --> 01:32:23,305
Forgive me, Murph.

1627
01:32:24,607 --> 01:32:26,141
There's nothing to forgive.

1628
01:32:28,977 --> 01:32:29,878
I...

1629
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:32,214
I lied, Murph.

1630
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:36,551
I lied to you.

1631
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:46,028
There was no need for him

1632
01:32:47,696 --> 01:32:49,064
to come back.

1633
01:32:52,134 --> 01:32:55,037
There is no...
No way to help us.

1634
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:57,305

All this. All these people.

1636
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:03,946
And the equation.

1637
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:09,818
Did my father know?

1638
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,190
Did he leave me?

1639
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:20,195

1640
01:33:21,797 --> 01:33:22,798
not

No!

1645
01:33:35,077 --> 01:33:36,645
You can't leave.

1646
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:38,113
You... No.

 I'm sorry to tell 

1648
01:33:41,383 --> 01:33:44,052
 that your father died today. 
 He had no pain. 

1649
01:33:44,787 --> 01:33:46,121
He was at peace.

1650
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:49,191
I'm very sorry for your loss.

 This was all a sham. 

1656
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:22,090

but undeniably beautiful.

Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali,

1694
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:26,194
and the air has too much
ammonia in it to breathe

1695
01:39:26,228 --> 01:39:28,230
for more than
just a few minutes,

1696

but down at the surface...
And there is a surface.

1697

...the chlorine dissipates.

1698
01:39:34,669 --> 01:39:36,704

to crystalline hydrocarbons

the first organics we found

as ammonia crystals.

He struggled on for a time,

1714
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:10,438
but ultimately
I decommissioned him

1715
01:40:10,472 --> 01:40:13,208

to keep the mission going.

his whole life to Plan A.

01:42:19,834 --> 01:42:22,604
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

1753
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:25,707
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1754
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:27,609
The equation couldn't
reconcile relativity

1755
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:29,211
with quantum mechanics.
You need more.

1756
01:42:29,677 --> 01:42:31,779

01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:33,248
DR. MANN: More data.

1758
01:42:33,281 --> 01:42:34,916
You need to see
into a black hole.

1759
01:42:34,949 --> 01:42:37,219
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1760
01:42:37,252 --> 01:42:38,353
Romilly, is that true?

1761
01:42:39,921 --> 01:42:41,856
If a black hole is an oyster,

1762
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:44,192
then the singularity's
the pearl inside.

1763
01:42:44,226 --> 01:42:46,561
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness

behind the horizon.

1765
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:51,799
That's why we call it
a black hole.

Okay, but (BREATHING HEAVILY)

beyond the horizon...

01:42:55,703 --> 01:42:57,705
We can't, Coop.

1769
01:42:57,739 --> 01:42:58,706
DR. MANN:
There are some things

1770
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:00,408
that aren't meant to be known.

1771
01:43:00,442 --> 01:43:02,277
Your father had to find
another way

1772
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:04,446
to save the human race
from extinction.

1773
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:05,980
Plan B. A colony.

1774
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:07,515
Why not tell people?

1775
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:11,286
Why keep building
those damn stations?

1776
01:43:11,319 --> 01:43:12,720
Because he knew
how hard it would be

1777
01:43:12,754 --> 01:43:14,856
to get people to work together
to save the species

1778
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:16,358
instead of themselves.

1779
01:43:16,891 --> 01:43:18,226
Or their children.

1780
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:19,794
Bullshit.

1781
01:43:19,827 --> 01:43:21,329
You never would've come here
unless you believed

1782
01:43:21,363 --> 01:43:22,730
you were gonna save them.

1783
01:43:22,764 --> 01:43:25,867
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1784
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,603
We can care deeply,
selflessly about

1785
01:43:28,636 --> 01:43:30,538
those we know, but
that empathy rarely extends

1786
01:43:30,572 --> 01:43:31,939
beyond our line of sight.

1787
01:43:31,973 --> 01:43:33,541
But the lie.

1788
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,347
That monstrous lie?

1789
01:43:40,615 --> 01:43:41,983
Unforgivable.

1790
01:43:42,016 --> 01:43:43,385
And he knew that.

1791
01:43:44,686 --> 01:43:46,588
He was prepared to destroy
his own humanity

1792
01:43:46,621 --> 01:43:48,956
in order to save the species.

1793
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:50,024
He made
an incredible sacrifice.

1794
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:50,958
No.

1795
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:55,297
No, an incredible sacrifice
is being made

1796
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:58,032
by the people on Earth
who are gonna die!

1797
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:00,802
Because in
his fucking arrogance

1798
01:44:00,835 --> 01:44:02,437
he declared
their case hopeless.

1799
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:04,572
I'm sorry, Cooper,

1800
01:44:05,473 --> 01:44:06,641
their case is hopeless.

1801
01:44:06,941 --> 01:44:08,676
No. No.

1802
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:10,945
We are the future.

1803
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:16,584
Cooper, what can I do?

1804
01:44:19,954 --> 01:44:21,656
Let me go home.

1805
01:44:22,724 --> 01:44:25,427
GETTY: You're
absolutely positive?

1806
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,329
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1807
01:44:28,062 --> 01:44:29,597
It's worthless?

1808
01:44:29,631 --> 01:44:30,598
It's half the answer.

1809
01:44:31,966 --> 01:44:34,569
Okay. How do you find
the other half?

1810
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:37,439
Out there? A black hole.

1811
01:44:37,472 --> 01:44:38,606
But stuck down here on Earth?

1812
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:39,807
Yeah?

1813
01:44:41,543 --> 01:44:42,810
I'm not sure you can.

1814
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:47,482
GETTY: God,
they just pack up and leave.

1815
01:44:49,351 --> 01:44:50,885
What are they hoping to find?

1816
01:44:51,653 --> 01:44:52,587
Survival.

1817
01:45:00,495 --> 01:45:01,463
Damn it.

1818
01:45:04,466 --> 01:45:06,334
Murph.

1819
01:45:06,368 --> 01:45:08,035
Don't... (SIGHS) Don't people
have a right to know?

1820
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:11,105
Well, panic won't help.

1821
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:13,475
We just have to keep working,
same as ever.

1822
01:45:13,508 --> 01:45:15,510
Yeah. But isn't that exactly

1823
01:45:15,543 --> 01:45:16,711
what Professor Brand was
manipulating us to do?

1824
01:45:16,744 --> 01:45:18,346
Brand gave up on us.

1825
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,747
I'm still trying
to solve this.

1826
01:45:20,548 --> 01:45:21,516
So...

1827
01:45:23,084 --> 01:45:24,586
Do you have an idea?

1828
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:26,621
A feeling.

1829
01:45:30,425 --> 01:45:31,893
 I told you about my ghost. 

1830
01:45:34,562 --> 01:45:36,764
 My dad thought 
 I called it a ghost 

1831
01:45:36,798 --> 01:45:38,032
because I was scared of it.

1832
01:45:41,936 --> 01:45:42,870
But I was never scared of it.

1833
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,809
 I called it a ghost 
 because it felt... 

1834
01:45:50,612 --> 01:45:51,913
It felt like a person.

1835
01:45:54,982 --> 01:45:56,083
It was trying to
tell me something.

1836
01:45:59,754 --> 01:46:02,056
If there's an answer
here on Earth, it's back there

1837
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:04,559
somehow, in that room.

1838
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:06,794
So I have to find it.

1839
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:08,963
(ENGINE STARTING)

1840
01:46:10,598 --> 01:46:11,933
We're running out of time.

1841
01:46:14,602 --> 01:46:16,538
 CASE: What about auxiliary 
 oxygen scrubbers? 

1842
01:46:16,571 --> 01:46:17,872
COOPER: No,
they can stay, CASE.

1843
01:46:17,905 --> 01:46:18,840
I'll be sleeping
most of the way, anyway.

1844
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:20,742
Hey, Coop.
Yeah.

1845
01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:22,744
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1846
01:46:22,777 --> 01:46:24,111
Yeah, what's that?

1847
01:46:24,145 --> 01:46:24,979
Have one last crack
at the black hole.

1848
01:46:27,181 --> 01:46:29,150
I'm going home, Rom.

1849
01:46:29,183 --> 01:46:31,919
Yeah, I know. This isn't going
to cost you any time.

1850
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,589
There's a chance
for the people on Earth.

1851
01:46:35,557 --> 01:46:37,158
Talk to me.

1852
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:38,993
Gargantua's an older
spinning black hole.

1853
01:46:39,026 --> 01:46:41,496
It's what we call
a gentle singularity.

1854
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:42,797
Gentle?

1855
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:44,466
They're hardly gentle.

1856
01:46:44,499 --> 01:46:46,768
But the tidal gravity
is so quick that

1857
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:49,203
something crossing the horizon
fast might survive.

1858
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,005
A probe, say.

1859
01:46:51,038 --> 01:46:52,640
What happens after it crosses?

1860
01:46:52,674 --> 01:46:56,110
After the horizon
is a complete mystery.

1861
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:59,213
So, what's to say there
isn't some way that the probe

1862
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:02,049
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1863
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:03,751
If he's equipped to transmit

1864
01:47:03,785 --> 01:47:05,853
every form of energy
that can pulse.

1865
01:47:05,887 --> 01:47:07,922
TARS: Just when did this probe
become a "he," Professor?

1866
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:10,157
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1867
01:47:11,693 --> 01:47:13,861
I've already told him
what to look for.

1868
01:47:13,895 --> 01:47:16,230
TARS: I need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

1869
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:17,899
You'd do this for us?

1870
01:47:17,932 --> 01:47:19,100
TARS: Before
you get all teary,

1871
01:47:19,133 --> 01:47:20,502
try to remember that
as a robot

1872
01:47:20,535 --> 01:47:21,536
I have to do anything you say.

1873
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,238
Your cue light's broken.

1874
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:25,640
TARS: I'm not joking.

1875
01:47:28,876 --> 01:47:30,512
I'm gonna need TARS
to remove and adapt

1876
01:47:30,545 --> 01:47:32,246
some components from KIPP.

1877
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:34,582
Well, I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1878
01:47:34,616 --> 01:47:35,717
ROMILLY: Oh, I'll supervise.

1879
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:37,852
All right.

1880
01:47:37,885 --> 01:47:40,254
Dr. Mann, we need to find
three secure sites.

1881
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:42,790
One for Brand's lab,
two for habitat.

1882
01:47:42,824 --> 01:47:45,126
Once those modules have landed
you don't want to move 'em.

1883
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:46,260
Well, I can take you
to the probe sites,

1884
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:47,862
but I don't think this...

1885
01:47:47,895 --> 01:47:49,096
These conditions
are gonna hold.

1886
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:50,698
I think we should wait.

1887
01:47:50,732 --> 01:47:52,099
COOPER: CASE is
headed back down

1888
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:53,935
with the rest
of the distillery equipment.

1889
01:47:53,968 --> 01:47:56,070
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1890
01:47:58,606 --> 01:48:01,075
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

1891
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:03,044
Okay then.

1892
01:48:03,077 --> 01:48:04,278
But you're gonna need

1893
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:05,647
a long-range transmitter.
Got it.

1894
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,814
Are you charged?
Yeah.

1895
01:48:07,615 --> 01:48:08,249

you feel you have to go back.

1899

But I'd be remiss if I didn't
at least mention that

a mission such as ours

1901
01:48:28,736 --> 01:48:31,005

an extra engineer.

I'm honored to be
a part of this.

my work's done here.

promise you that,
that yearning to be

2470
02:28:54,493 --> 02:28:57,262
COOPER: TARS, give me
the coordinates for NASA

2471
02:28:57,296 --> 02:28:59,164
in binary.

2472
02:28:59,198 --> 02:29:01,133
 TARS: In binary. Roger. 
 Feeding data. 

2473
02:29:25,590 --> 02:29:27,326
"It's not a ghost."

2474
02:29:29,328 --> 02:29:31,430
"It's gravity."

2475
02:29:31,463 --> 02:29:32,497
COOPER: (PANTING)
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2476
02:29:33,465 --> 02:29:35,067
I brought myself here!

2477
02:29:36,535 --> 02:29:39,371
We're here to communicate with
a three-dimensional world.

2478
02:29:40,139 --> 02:29:41,340
We're the bridge!

2479
02:29:49,614 --> 02:29:51,183
I thought they chose me.

2480
02:29:55,154 --> 02:29:57,089
But they didn't choose me,
they chose her.

2481
02:29:57,122 --> 02:29:58,257
TARS: For what, Cooper? 
(LAUGHS)

2482
02:30:01,126 --> 02:30:02,461
To save the world.

2483
02:30:07,166 --> 02:30:09,734
All of this
is one little girl's bedroom.

2484
02:30:09,768 --> 02:30:11,536
Every moment.

2485
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:13,372
It's infinitely complex.

2486
02:30:13,405 --> 02:30:15,640
They have access
to infinite time and space,

2487
02:30:15,674 --> 02:30:18,243
but they're not
bound by anything!

2488
02:30:18,277 --> 02:30:21,480
They can't find
a specific place in time.

2489
02:30:21,513 --> 02:30:22,481
They can't communicate.

2490
02:30:24,649 --> 02:30:27,352
That's why I'm here. I'm gonna
find a way to tell Murph,

2491
02:30:27,386 --> 02:30:29,121
just like I found this moment.

2492
02:30:29,154 --> 02:30:30,289
TARS: How, Cooper? 

2493
02:30:30,322 --> 02:30:31,790
Love, TARS, love.

2494
02:30:31,823 --> 02:30:34,126
It's just like Brand said.
My connection with Murph,

2495
02:30:34,159 --> 02:30:36,328
it is quantifiable.
It's the key!

2496
02:30:36,361 --> 02:30:37,696
TARS: What are we here to do? 

2497
02:30:39,131 --> 02:30:40,532
Find how to tell her.

2498
02:30:43,568 --> 02:30:44,669
The watch.

2499
02:30:48,107 --> 02:30:49,108
The watch.

2500
02:30:50,542 --> 02:30:51,510
That's it.

2501
02:30:54,713 --> 02:30:57,116
We code the data into the
movement of the second hand.

2502
02:31:01,386 --> 02:31:04,523
TARS, translate the data
into Morse and feed it to me.

2503
02:31:04,556 --> 02:31:06,391
 TARS: Translating data 
 into Morse. 

2504
02:31:06,425 --> 02:31:08,360
 Cooper, what if she 
 never came back for it? 

2505
02:31:10,295 --> 02:31:12,631
She will. She will.

2506
02:31:14,366 --> 02:31:15,400
GETTY: Murph,
I can see his car!

2507
02:31:16,868 --> 02:31:17,702
He's coming, Murph!

2508
02:31:19,904 --> 02:31:21,540
Okay. I'm coming down.

2509
02:31:23,375 --> 02:31:24,509
TARS: How do you know? 

2510
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:29,548
Because I gave it to her.

2511
02:31:35,587 --> 02:31:37,456
 TARS: Roger. 
 Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot. 

2512
02:31:41,226 --> 02:31:42,161
COOPER: Dot-dot-

2513
02:31:43,595 --> 02:31:45,164
dash-dot.

2514
02:31:45,797 --> 02:31:47,832
TARS: Dot-dash-dot-dot. 

2515
02:31:47,866 --> 02:31:50,802
COOPER: Dot-dash-dot-dot.

2516
02:31:50,835 --> 02:31:52,637
TARS: Dash-dash-dash. 

2517
02:31:52,671 --> 02:31:54,606
COOPER: Dash-dash-dash.

2518
02:32:05,517 --> 02:32:06,418
(GASPS)

2519
02:32:12,957 --> 02:32:14,193
MURPH: He came back!

2520
02:32:15,694 --> 02:32:19,298
It was him all this time!
I didn't know. It was him!

2521
02:32:20,732 --> 02:32:22,334
Dad's gonna save us.

2522
02:33:05,009 --> 02:33:06,345
Eureka!

2523
02:33:10,415 --> 02:33:11,450
It's traditional.

2524
02:33:14,553 --> 02:33:17,589
(LAUGHING) Eureka!

2525
02:33:22,494 --> 02:33:24,496
Did it work?

2526
02:33:24,529 --> 02:33:25,730
TARS: I think it might have. 

2527
02:33:27,399 --> 02:33:29,401
How do you know?

2528
02:33:29,434 --> 02:33:31,903
 TARS: Because the bulk beings 
 are closing the tesseract. 

2529
02:33:36,275 --> 02:33:37,776
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2530
02:33:39,344 --> 02:33:40,779
They're not "beings."

2531
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:42,781
They're us.

2532
02:33:45,617 --> 02:33:48,287
What I've been doing for
Murph, they're doing for me.

2533
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:50,789
For all of us.

2534
02:33:50,822 --> 02:33:52,891
 TARS: Cooper, 
 people couldn't build this. 

2535
02:33:52,924 --> 02:33:54,926
COOPER: No. No, not yet.

2536
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:56,795
But one day.

2537
02:33:57,862 --> 02:34:00,799
Not you and me. But a people.

2538
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:03,768
A civilization that's evolved

2539
02:34:03,802 --> 02:34:05,770
past the four dimensions
we know.

2540
02:34:05,804 --> 02:34:07,306
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

2541
02:34:12,444 --> 02:34:13,545
COOPER: What happens now?

2542
02:35:16,475 --> 02:35:17,609
DOCTOR: Mr. Cooper.

2543
02:35:22,046 --> 02:35:24,115
Let's take it slow, sir.

2544
02:35:24,148 --> 02:35:26,751
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

2545
02:35:26,785 --> 02:35:28,687
Remember, you're
no spring chicken anymore.

2546
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:31,356
Actually,
you are 124 years old.

2547
02:35:34,993 --> 02:35:37,796
(PEOPLE PLAYING BASEBALL
OUTSIDE)

2548
02:35:38,563 --> 02:35:39,631
Take it slow, sir.

2549
02:35:40,932 --> 02:35:43,702
You were extremely lucky.

2550
02:35:43,735 --> 02:35:45,103
The Rangers found you
with only minutes left

2551
02:35:45,136 --> 02:35:46,538
in your oxygen supply.

2552
02:35:57,616 --> 02:35:59,684
(CHEERING AND LAUGHING)

2553
02:36:00,852 --> 02:36:01,953
Where am I?

2554
02:36:04,022 --> 02:36:05,356
DOCTOR: Cooper Station.

2555
02:36:07,025 --> 02:36:08,126
Currently orbiting Saturn.

2556
02:36:10,529 --> 02:36:12,363
Cooper Station.

2557
02:36:15,133 --> 02:36:16,968
Nice of you
to name it after me.

2558
02:36:17,001 --> 02:36:17,936
(LAUGHS)

2559
02:36:20,705 --> 02:36:22,441
What?

2560
02:36:22,474 --> 02:36:23,808
The station
isn't named after you, sir.

2561
02:36:23,842 --> 02:36:24,943
It's named
after your daughter.

2562
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:27,646
Although she's
always maintained

2563
02:36:27,679 --> 02:36:28,947
just how important you were.

2564
02:36:28,980 --> 02:36:30,482
Is she still alive?

2565
02:36:32,751 --> 02:36:34,152
She'll be here
in a couple weeks.

2566
02:36:35,587 --> 02:36:36,921
She is far too old

2567
02:36:36,955 --> 02:36:38,189
to be transferring
from another station,

2568
02:36:38,222 --> 02:36:40,391
but when she heard
that you'd been found...

2569
02:36:41,626 --> 02:36:42,927
Well, this is...

2570
02:36:42,961 --> 02:36:44,095
This is Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

2571
02:36:45,196 --> 02:36:46,631
Yes, it is.

2572
02:36:49,501 --> 02:36:51,102
DOCTOR: We'll have you checked
out of here in a couple days.

2573
02:36:54,606 --> 02:36:56,107
I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store.

2574
02:36:58,242 --> 02:37:02,481
I actually did a paper on you
in high school.

2575
02:37:02,514 --> 02:37:04,148
I know all about your life
back on Earth.

2576
02:37:06,084 --> 02:37:07,118
Oh, yeah.

2577
02:37:07,686 --> 02:37:08,553
Right.

2578
02:37:11,823 --> 02:37:13,057
If you'll follow me,

2579
02:37:13,091 --> 02:37:16,194
we've got a really
good situation for you.

2580
02:37:20,198 --> 02:37:23,702
So, um, when I made
my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

2581
02:37:25,236 --> 02:37:27,005
I was delighted to hear that
she thought it was perfect.

2582
02:37:31,142 --> 02:37:32,143
 OLD WOMAN 1:
 It was just constant. 

2583
02:37:32,176 --> 02:37:34,913
 Just that steady blow of dirt. 

2584
02:37:34,946 --> 02:37:37,882
Of course, I didn't
speak to her personally.

2585
02:37:37,916 --> 02:37:39,851
 We always 
 set the plate upside-down. 

2586
02:37:39,884 --> 02:37:42,954
 Glasses or cups, 
 whatever it was, upside-down. 

2587
02:37:42,987 --> 02:37:47,826
 My dad was a farmer. 
 Like everybody else back then. 

2588
02:37:47,859 --> 02:37:50,795
 There just wasn't enough food. 

2589
02:37:50,829 --> 02:37:53,798
 OLD WOMAN 2: We wore 
 little things, little strips 

2590
02:37:53,832 --> 02:37:57,702
 of sheet, put it sometimes 
 over our nose and mouth, 

2591
02:37:57,736 --> 02:37:59,103
 so we wouldn't 
 breathe so much of it. 

2592
02:37:59,137 --> 02:38:02,574
 Well, it was pretty exciting 
 for me because it was hope. 

2593
02:38:02,607 --> 02:38:04,242
 OLD MAN: I don't care 
 who describes it, 

2594
02:38:04,275 --> 02:38:06,711
 there is no way for it to be 
 exaggerated. It was that bad. 

2595
02:38:06,745 --> 02:38:08,547
ADMINISTRATOR: She did confirm

2596
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:10,682
just how much
you loved farming.

2597
02:38:10,715 --> 02:38:12,216
Oh, she did, did she?
Yeah.

2598
02:38:12,250 --> 02:38:14,085
Here we are.

2599
02:38:14,118 --> 02:38:15,987
Home sweet home.

2600
02:38:16,020 --> 02:38:18,923
Everything replaced
and put back where it...

2601
02:38:25,597 --> 02:38:26,531
Hey, is this...

2602
02:38:26,565 --> 02:38:28,132
Oh, yeah.

2603
02:38:28,166 --> 02:38:31,035
The machine we found out near
Saturn when we found you, yes.

2604
02:38:31,069 --> 02:38:32,737
Its power source was shot,

2605
02:38:32,771 --> 02:38:33,838
but we could get you
another one if you want it.

2606
02:38:33,872 --> 02:38:35,707
Yes. Please.

2607
02:38:37,075 --> 02:38:38,176
TARS: Settings.

2608
02:38:39,010 --> 02:38:40,979
General settings.

2609
02:38:41,012 --> 02:38:42,714
Security settings.

2610
02:38:45,717 --> 02:38:47,752
Honesty, new setting,

2611
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:51,122
95%.

2612
02:38:51,155 --> 02:38:53,091
TARS: Confirmed.
Additional customization?

2613
02:38:54,125 --> 02:38:55,093
Humor,

2614
02:38:56,928 --> 02:38:58,096
75%.

2615
02:38:58,797 --> 02:38:59,898
TARS: Confirmed.

2616
02:39:00,965 --> 02:39:04,068
Auto self-destruct
T minus 10, nine...

2617
02:39:04,102 --> 02:39:05,870
Let's make that 60%.

2618
02:39:08,306 --> 02:39:10,174
TARS: 60% confirmed.

2619
02:39:11,109 --> 02:39:12,744
Knock-knock.

2620
02:39:12,777 --> 02:39:13,978
You want 55?

2621
02:39:19,217 --> 02:39:20,885
TARS: Is this really
what it was like?

2622
02:39:23,822 --> 02:39:25,590
It was never this clean,
Slick. (CHUCKLES)

2623
02:39:30,261 --> 02:39:32,296
I don't care much for this

2624
02:39:32,330 --> 02:39:33,732
pretending we're back
where we started.

2625
02:39:36,234 --> 02:39:38,036
I want to know where we are.

2626
02:39:40,071 --> 02:39:41,205
 Where we're going. 

2627
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:48,847
Mr. Cooper.
The family's all in there.

2628
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:50,815
Family?

2629
02:39:50,849 --> 02:39:52,283
Yeah, they all came out
to see her.

2630
02:39:52,316 --> 02:39:54,118
She's been in cryo-sleep
for almost two years.

2631
02:40:10,902 --> 02:40:11,970
(SOBBING)

2632
02:40:27,719 --> 02:40:29,988
You told 'em I like farming.

2633
02:40:30,021 --> 02:40:31,189
(LAUGHING)

2634
02:40:35,293 --> 02:40:36,795
It was me, Murph.

2635
02:40:39,731 --> 02:40:41,032
I was your ghost.

2636
02:40:42,701 --> 02:40:43,935
I know.

2637
02:40:46,204 --> 02:40:47,939
People didn't believe me.

2638
02:40:47,972 --> 02:40:50,274
They thought that
I was doing it all myself.

2639
02:40:50,842 --> 02:40:51,743
But...

2640
02:40:54,846 --> 02:40:56,380
I knew who it was.

2641
02:41:01,853 --> 02:41:03,354
Nobody believed me.

2642
02:41:04,488 --> 02:41:06,657
But I knew you'd come back.

2643
02:41:09,093 --> 02:41:10,161
How?

2644
02:41:12,731 --> 02:41:15,233
Because my dad promised me.

2645
02:41:21,773 --> 02:41:23,307
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2646
02:41:24,843 --> 02:41:25,977
I'm here.

2647
02:41:27,779 --> 02:41:28,813
No.

2648
02:41:31,750 --> 02:41:34,986
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

2649
02:41:38,322 --> 02:41:40,691
I have my kids here
for me now.

2650
02:41:43,327 --> 02:41:44,796
You go.

2651
02:41:48,232 --> 02:41:49,233
Where?

2652
02:41:53,171 --> 02:41:54,338
Brand.

2653
02:42:04,148 --> 02:42:05,483
 She's out there, 

2654
02:42:12,156 --> 02:42:13,825
 setting up camp. 

2655
02:42:40,919 --> 02:42:42,053
 Alone 

2656
02:42:43,922 --> 02:42:45,790
 in a strange galaxy. 

2657
02:42:57,568 --> 02:43:01,505
 Maybe right now she's 
 settling in for the long nap 

2658
02:43:20,424 --> 02:43:22,861
 by the light of our new sun 

2659
02:43:38,442 --> 02:43:40,211
 in our new home.
